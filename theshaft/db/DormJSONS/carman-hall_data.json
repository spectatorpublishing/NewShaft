  "What Students Say": "“Spacious and well lit rooms, with a great 4-to-1 bathroom ratio. [Carman Hall has an] excellent location, and the setup is conducive to meeting new people—all important during [your] first year.” “Carman was the perfect hall for me my first-year at Columbia. It was extremely social; everyone was always in the hallways and lounges talking, watching TV, or just hanging out. It is very difficult to feel isolated in such a lively dorm.” “Carman Hall was an awesome place to live. While it is the \"social\" first-year hall, you don't have to join in on the party all the time. The best friends I made at Columbia were made on Carman 7.”"
