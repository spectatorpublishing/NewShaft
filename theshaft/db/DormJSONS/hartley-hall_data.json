  "What Students Say": "â€œHartley was a great place to spend my first year at Columbia. Living in such a comfortable setting with upperclassmen really helped me learn the ins-and-outs of Columbia, and it was great to be so close to the action on campus.\" \"Hartley is not only a nice place to live, but has a convenient location. Just downstairs in the lobby is the Hartley Hospitality Desk, a CUIT computer lab, and a lounge with pool and ping pong tables! In addition, it only takes two minutes to get to classes in Hamilton.\""
