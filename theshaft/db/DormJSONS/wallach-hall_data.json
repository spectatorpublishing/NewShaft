It's great to have people who have [already] been through [their own first year] as a reference, especially when registering. It can be quiet in Wallach, which creates a great study environment. But if y you're feeling social, all you have to do is walk out of your room and bother your neighbors.\" â€œThe LLC hosts many annual events that are community-building.
