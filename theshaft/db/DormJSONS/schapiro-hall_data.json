  "What Students Say": "“Schapiro is equipped with excellent amenities—carpet flooring, a common lounge, a kitchen, adequate bathrooms, music rooms, and of course the sky lounge! [Schapiro] had a lovely off-campus feel for me, which was a good break from the intensities of on-campus first-year living.”"
