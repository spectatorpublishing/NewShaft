  "What Students Say": "“The quality of the facilities and rooms in Furnald is top-notch; it feels more like a hotel than a hall. Also, living with sophomores on my hall was very helpful when I needed advice on what classes to take or which restaurants in the city are the best. Having a single was great as a first-year. Overall, I had a very positive experience in Furnald.” “Furnald boasts an aesthetically nice living environment that is nothing but pleasant. The halls are quiet, the bathrooms are clean, and the furniture is generally well kept.” Good study atmosphere; known for being both clean and quiet"
